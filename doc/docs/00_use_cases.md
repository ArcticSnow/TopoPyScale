## Genesis project (2025)
The [Genesis project](https://genesisnbs.eu/) , funded by [Horizon Europe](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101157447 ), aims to study how climatic risks affect Nature based Solutions in the water sector, in the Macaronesian archipelagos. TopoPyScale was applied to downscale 30 years of ERA5 hourly data to the topography of Canary Islands, Azores, Madeira and Cape Verde, from ~25 km to 180 m DEM (from resampled SRTM data). This data has been used as input to estimate extreme weather events using GEV distribution among other methods, and serve as information to elaborate the risk profiles which engineers and other stackeholders in the project need for further quantitative risk analysis.

## SnowMapper.ch Online Dashboard

[SnowMapper](https://snowmapper.ch) is a tool that generates high-resolution maps of snow variables (snow height, snow water equivalent and snow melt) at daily timescales. The SnowMapper is an online operational snow mapping and forecasting tool for High-Mountain Central Asia (HMCA). The two main components required to achieve this are the climate downscaling tool [TopoPyscale](https://topopyscale.readthedocs.io/) and the Factorial Snow Model, [FSM](https://github.com/RichardEssery/FSM), developed by Richard Essery [@essery2015]. Visualisation and web deployment is handled by the [MCASS package](https://github.com/hydrosolutions/MCASS). SnowMapper was developed as a collaboration between the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF and hydrosolutions GmbH within the SDC-funded projects CROMO-ADAPT and SAPPHIRE.
