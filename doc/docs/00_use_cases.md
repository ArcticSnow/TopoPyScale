## SnowMapper.ch Online Dashboard

[SnowMapper](https://snowmapper.ch) is a tool that generates high-resolution maps of snow variables (snow height, snow water equivalent and snow melt) at daily timescales. The SnowMapper is an online operational snow mapping and forecasting tool for High-Mountain Central Asia (HMCA). The two main components required to achieve this are the climate downscaling tool [TopoPyscale](https://topopyscale.readthedocs.io/) and the Factorial Snow Model, [FSM](https://github.com/RichardEssery/FSM), developed by Richard Essery [@essery2015]. Visualisation and web deployment is handled by the [MCASS package](https://github.com/hydrosolutions/MCASS). SnowMapper was developed as a collaboration between the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF and hydrosolutions GmbH within the SDC-funded projects CROMO-ADAPT and SAPPHIRE.
